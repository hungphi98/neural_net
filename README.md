# neural_net
implementation of neural network from scratch using javascript

This project implements a basic neural network that solves a logistics regression problem. It also provides a module for recurrent neural network with and without lstm. 

To run the program, cd to your directory,

<code>npm install</code> 

<code>nodemon server.js</code> 

And open your favorite browser, redirect to <code>localhost:3000</code>

Right now it does not have an interface so you probably needs to run the function inside console. The main test functions are in Test.js
